# Linear Search

**Linear search** (also known as sequential search) is the simplest search algorithm. It checks each element in a list sequentially until it finds the target value or reaches the end of the list.

### Characteristics

- **Time Complexity**:  
  - Best case: `O(1)` — target is the first element.  
  - Average case: `O(n)` — target is in the middle.  
  - Worst case: `O(n)` — target is the last element or not present.

- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` — no additional memory required beyond input and a few variables.

- **Requirements**:  
  - Does not require the list to be sorted.  
  - Works on any data structure that allows sequential access (arrays, lists, etc.).

### When to Use

- Small datasets.
- Unsorted data.
- Single or infrequent searches.
- Prototyping or educational purposes.
