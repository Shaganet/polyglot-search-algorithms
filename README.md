# polyglot-search-algorithms

## Repository goal

This project was created to:

* Deeply understand the search algorithms.
* Learn the syntax and features of different programming languages.
* Compare approaches

## Implemented search algorithms

| Algorithm | Description |
|---------------------------|----------|
| **Linear search**        | Sequential iteration of elements. |
| **Binary Search**        | Efficient search in a **sorted** array. |
| **Exponential search**| A combination of exponential run-up and binary search. |
| **Interpolation search**| Improved binary search for **evenly distributed** data. |
| **Levenshtein Distance**| Measures measures the degree of similarity of operations to transform one string into another. |

## Supported programming languages

C# | C++ | Fortran | Go | Haskell
Java | JavaScript | Kotlin | MATLAB | PHP
Pascal | Perl | Python | Rust | Swift
TypeScript | Visual Basic .NET (Mono)

 ‚ùó For languages where the installation of the environment is difficult, online compilers were used.
