# polyglot-search-algorithms

## Repository goal

This project was created to:

- Deeply understand the search algorithms.
- Learn the syntax and features of different programming languages.
- Compare approaches.

## Implemented search algorithms

| Algorithm | Description |
|---------------------------|----------|
| [Linear search](Linear_search)        | Sequential iteration of elements. |
| **Binary Search**        | Efficient search in a **sorted** array. |
| **Exponential search**| A combination of exponential run-up and binary search. |
| **Interpolation search**| Improved binary search for **evenly distributed** data. |
| **Levenshtein Distance**| Computes the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, substitutions) required to change one string into another. |

## Supported programming languages

Languages are grouped by their primary programming paradigm to help you navigate by conceptual style.

| Imperative / Procedural | Object-oriented | Functional | Multi-paradigm |
|----------------------------|--------------------------|----------------|---------------------|
| Pascal                     | Java                     | Haskell        | Python              |
| Fortran                    | C#                       |                | C++                 |
|                            | Swift                    |                | Rust                |
|                            | Kotlin                   |                | Go                  |
|                            | VB.NET                   |                | JavaScript          |
|                            |                          |                | TypeScript          |
|                            |                          |                | PHP                 |
|                            |                          |                | Perl                |
|                            |                          |                | MATLAB              |

> **Note**: For languages where the installation of the environment is difficult, online compilers were used.
