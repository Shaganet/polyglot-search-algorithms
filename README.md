# polyglot-search-algorithms

## Repository goal

This project was created to:

- Deeply understand the search algorithms.
- Learn the syntax and features of different programming languages.
- Compare various approaches.

## Implemented search algorithms

| Algorithm | Description |
|---------------------------|----------|
| [Linear search](Linear_search)        | Sequential iteration of elements. |
| **Binary Search**        | Efficient search in a **sorted** array. |
| **Exponential search**| A combination of exponential run-up and binary search. |
| **Interpolation search**| Improved binary search for **evenly distributed** data. |
| **Levenshtein Distance**| Computes the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions, substitutions) required to change one string into another. |

## Supported programming languages

Languages are grouped by their primary programming paradigm to help you navigate by conceptual style.

| Imperative / Procedural | Object-oriented | Functional       | Multi-paradigm      |
|-------------------------|-----------------|------------------|---------------------|
| Pascal                  | Java            | Haskell          | Python              |

| C                       | Swift           | Elixir           | Rust                |
| COBOL                   | Kotlin          | Scala            | Go                  |
| Ada                     | Visual Basic    |                  | JavaScript          |

|                         |                 |                  | PHP                 |
|                         |                 |                  | Perl                |
|                         |                 |                  | MATLAB              |
|                         |                 |                  | Dart                |
|                         |                 |                  | Zig                 |

> **Note**: For languages where the installation of the environment is difficult, online compilers were used.
